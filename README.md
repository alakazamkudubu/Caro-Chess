Caro is the Vietnamese version of Tic-Tac-Toe, but played on a large grid paper where the Xs and Os are placed on the grid intersection instead of in the middle of the square. Since there is "unlimited" space for each game, the first to get 5 in a row wins.
It is important to note that in some variations, if you do get 5 in a row, but this Winning Line is blocked on both ends by your opponent, it becomes invalid. I have opted not to implement this feature since it is more of a personal preference than a concrete rule. X ALWASYS GOES FIRST! That is an immutable rule!
I did not learn how to use java.swing prior to making this, so the codebase is very primitive, however it is 100% funtional. It is Object oriented and well organized.
